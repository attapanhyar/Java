Figure 1 above shows the comparative analysis of effective capacity with SNR. The SNR value is shown in dBs.It is clearly visible in the graph that effective capacity is increasing exponentially as we increase the SNR of channel up to a certain limit. For example, it visible that the effective capacity is increasing exponentially when SNR values are less than 10 dB.But, as the SNR is monotonically increasing, gradually the effective capacity decreases to improve. It could be hypothetically said that at certain point, increase in signal to ratio produce no change in effective capacity of the channel. In wireless communication systems, if the transmission rate is fixed, it may lead to wastage of scarce resource.we can conclude form the results in figure 1 that fixed transmission rate does not increase the effective capacity by increasing the singal to noise ratio. If the  increase in the signal power produce no significant change in effective capacity that means wastage of resources. In the graph, author has tested different values of Quality of service i-e theta =10 and theta =0.1, keeping transmision rate fixed to one bit per second (1bps). It can be concluded that  effects of fixed transmission rate are fixed for the effective capacity. The figure also show that increase of effective capacity is more rapid when delay constraint is less stringent.
